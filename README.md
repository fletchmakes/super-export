![hero image](./assets/hero.png)

An Aseprite extension that allows you to export your sprites at sizes greater than 1000% (and also percentages that aren't multiples of 100, like 467%)!

## How to Use Super Export

1. Download this extension by visiting the releases page! (Double click the extension once downloaded to install)
2. Open a sprite you'd like to export, and select `File > Super Export...`
3. Type in a percentage greater than (or equal to) 100%
    * If there is an active selection on the canvas, you will be given the option to choose to export just the selected region, if you wish.
4. Complete the dialogs
5. Enjoy your newly resized sprite!
